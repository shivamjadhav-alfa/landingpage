							</header>

							<p>Edusol, to be understood on a wider note is a website that can act as a bridge between competitive world and the students. We will create a platform where the students can consult us and can get the best solution for their queries. The best solutions are not easy to obtain hence we, team Edusol follow a unique pattern to provide solution to the query. We analyze their skill set by a unique test called ‘Career Guidance Test’. Well have a talk to the person to know his interest which is mandatory to continue in a course, then we'll guide him/her towards the suitable course. This process as a whole will spotlight on the perfect planning and the picture perfect guidance to the students.</p>

							<h3>From The Desk Of Founder-</h3>
							<p> I always had a notion that the initialstep to success is analyzing and exploring one's own skill, work on it andpathwaying the future accordingly. Identifying skill set is not a kid's playand in these days with the absence of proper resources and guidance it's aHerculean task. I strongly believe in the concept that every person as anindividual has a skill when worked upon properly it turns out to be talent.Edusol steps in the zone where individuals think they are incapable of doingsomething just because of the lack of resources. We,Edusol provide theplatform where the spotlight is set on the skill set of a person and liftsthat up to become talent through the right guidance. Right ideas aren't easyto evolve but they aren't impossible too. I finally would like to say thatknowing ourselves and aiming for the apt dream/goal set is the runway tosuccess</p>
